    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>1 roll (16.5 oz) Pillsbury™ refrigerated sugar cookies</li>
          <li>3 packages (8 oz each) cream cheese, softened</li>
          <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
          <li>3 eggs</li>
          <li>1/2 cup seedless strawberry jam (or raspberry jam, if desired)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>6 Easy Steps</h3>
      <ol>
          <li> Heat oven to 350°F. Press cookie dough evenly in bottom of ungreased 13x9-inch pan. (If dough is sticky, use floured fingers.)</li>
          <li> In large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar with electric mixer on medium speed until blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating on low speed after each, just until blended. (Don’t overbeat.) Spread cream cheese filling in pan over dough.</li>
          <li> Place jam in small resealable food-storage plastic bag; seal bag. Cut off small corner of bag. Squeeze jam on cream cheese mixture in 5 thick lines the length of the pan.</li>
          <li> Use knife to pull all jam lines from top to bottom through cream cheese mixture at 1-inch intervals.</li>
          <li> Bake 55 to 60 minutes or until filling is set in center. Remove from oven to cooling rack. Cool 30 minutes. Refrigerate at least 1 1/2 hours. To serve, cut into 6 rows by 3 rows. Store covered in refrigerator.</li>
          <li> ENJOY!</li>
